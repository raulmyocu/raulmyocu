### Hi there (QuiÃºbole!), I'm RaÃºl ğŸ‘‹

I am a computer science student at Universidad de Sonora, currently on my fourth year.
My main interests are Artificial Intelligence, Theory of Computation and also fun math stuff c:

I also enjoy playing the guitar / singing and solving the Rubik's cube.

You can check out my [blog](https://raulmyocu.github.io/blog), where I post stuff I find interesting.
